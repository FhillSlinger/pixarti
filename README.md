<h2>What is this project?</h1>
<p>This project was created using Vite, React.js, Styled-components and Typescript, there are a lot of workarounds in the project because I had no idea where to start.</p>
<p>The project works as follows, you draw a pixel art on the frame and click on the finish button in the upper left corner of the options menu, after that copy the html/css code that will appear on your screen after that just paste it in your html that you will have your pixel art.</p>
